Kubernetes provides an ideal platform for #hosting various workloads, including dynamic workloads based on AI applications that support ubiquitous computing devices #leveraging parallel and distributed architectures. The rationale is that Kubernetes can be used to support backend services #running on parallel and distributed architectures, hosting ubiquitous cloud computing workloads. These applications support #smart homes and concerts, providing an environment that automatically scales based on demand. While Kubernetes does offer #support for auto scaling of Pods to support these workloads, automated scaling of the cluster itself is not currently offered. #In this paper we introduce a Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) solution for autoscaling Kubernetes (K8s) worker nodes within #a cluster to support dynamic workloads. We go on to discuss scalability issues and security concerns both on the platform and #within the hosted AI applications."
